\section{profile}

A highly passionate software engineer specialized in Go (Golang) and TypeScript, with experience in writing low-latency, highly available and scalable microservices
for staffing and finance domain, and sports betting industry. I enjoy the dynamic of working in a progressive environment and knowing that my work
directly affects the direction and success of the business. I have experience of working autonomously; however I recognize the greater value of both teamwork and collaboration.
