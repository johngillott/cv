__Ryan Gough__, Head of Engineering at GRI UK

“John is an excellent software developer who I was lucky enough to work with for just under 2 years at GRI. He led the development effort on some complex pieces of work and did a great job. He helped push through improvements to working practices and was generally a fantastic team member. John would be a great asset for any software development team.”

“I hired John through our graduate programme, through which he showed immediate promise and his infectious enthusiasm. He is diligent, genial and as effective on a solo project as he is in an agile team. I am proud that he chose our company as his first opportunity to excel in a commercial environment and firmly believe that he'd be an asset to any software engineering team.”
